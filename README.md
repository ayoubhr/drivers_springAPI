# drivers_springAPI
Java spring basics

Backend API Rest done with the Spring Boot application.

The services connect to a mongoDB database where we load the JSON collection with the documents.

JSON collection: "data_dos.json" can be found on the app folder.

mongoDB: load the "data_dos.json" on "admin" database. If you want to load it in a different mongoDB database you can change that in the file
"drivers_springAPI/src/main/java/com/everis/appf1/Repository/MongoConfig.java".
